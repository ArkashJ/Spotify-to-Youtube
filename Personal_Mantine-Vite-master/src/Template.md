Boilerplate for what the UI should look like:

1) Navbar with the spotify logo pointing to the youtube logo
    a) Add About, Introduction, functionality elements
2) Main body:
    1) Use API to transfer data from spotify
    2) Display 30 songs from the list
    3) Store the data in mongo
    4) Call Youtube API and pass that information to it
