Project Idea 1: Spotify and Youtube Playlist Transfer

The main purpose of this idea is to transfer playlists between music services. We will have a website where a user will log into their Spotify and Youtube accounts. From there, they choose whatever spotify playlist they want on their youtube account. We then create a new playlist on youtube, and add the songs that are in the spotify playlist. This will also work the other way around, transferring a youtube playlist to spotify.


Project Idea 2: Modified Hub Course Search

An app to make searching for hub courses easier
Searching for a class to fulfill a Hub unit can be very stressful and tedious, since you would have to scroll through a long list of courses that don’t interest you, conflict with your schedule, aren’t being offered next semester, and so on. It takes way too much time to manually filter through all of them, and there are too many factors to consider. This application will help you search for the most suitable course by considering:
- The required Hub unit
- A topic related to your interests
- Whether the course is offered in the Spring or Fall
- Any prerequisites or exclusive to certain majors
- Conflicts with your current schedule, accessed through Google Calendar
As an OAuth, you can sign in to your Google account to share your calendar so the software knows which time slots work best for you. The app would use a web scraping API to gather the course listings data from the BU course search webpage. We could integrate a sentiment analysis API to associate the interests inputted by the user with the description of the course to assess whether that course would be a good match. The app should then present you with a short list of the most compatible hub courses for your query. From there you can decide to add that course to your calendar. We could also link relevant pages to learn more about the course, such as a link to the course’s webpage from a previous semester, or a Reddit thread to read past student experiences with the course.
